# giphy-fun

## What is this project

This project is a simple example of using AJAX to place a call to the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/) using a search term, and parse the JSON returning ten or more gifs related to the search term, along with the gif rating.

## What does this project do

Use the prepopulated buttons or enter your own search term to retrieve gifs. Click on the still image to play the gif. Click the gif to pause the gif. You can add as many buttons as you like.

## Why the project is useful

To get some kick ass gifs, duh!
